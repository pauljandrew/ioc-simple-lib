  <h2>IoC Simple Library</h2>
  <blockquote>A simple IoC library</blockquote>

## Notes:

- Used https://github.com/DevUnltd/js-library-boilerplate-basic to get a quick library boilerplate starting point

- The library exposes 3 main public functions: register, resolve and remove

- Logging functionality can be left enabled or disabled by the client

- JSDoc is used to document each function - could be used for validation in a further iteration

- Only supports registering of classes and transient objects, no support for singletons

- Some example unit tests in lib/test.js

- Example functionality of Car and Engine can be seen in src/demo/index.js and in console logs of the page loaded by `npm start`

- Private functions are prefixed with _

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started
